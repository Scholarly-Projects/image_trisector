# image_trisector

A failed but insightful experiment to create a tool that can trisect an image into fore, middle and background, which is how I am creating the current poster series for digital collection outreach. Working with distance mapping libraries, this was still unable to extract the fore and middle ground of sample cases. _Andrew Weymouth, Fall 2024_.
